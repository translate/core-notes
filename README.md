# Pootle Core Triaging Notes

Pootle Core members will meet weekly to triage existing issues and discuss
further development plans and priorities.

These meetings are open to anyone who is willing to contribute fixing issues
with code. If you feel like a ticket should be revised in the next meeting,
please [file a new issue](https://github.com/translate/core-notes/issues/new) to
flag us about it.

This repo is heavily inspired by the [React Core Meeting
Notes](https://github.com/reactjs/core-notes).
